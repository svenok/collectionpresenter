Collection Presenter offers a presentation platform for biological collections using a Darwin Core compatible database. Besides search and retrieve functions based on many parameters, it includes image display, mapping, and various tools associated with collection management. It comes with the source PHP code, an empty MySQL database, and some base maps. The user has to populate the database and set a number of configuration parameters. A simple installation requires no dependencies, a full installation uses Image Magick and JPgraph. Collection Presenter is tested with PHP 5, MySQL 4 and 5, and Apache 2.0 and 2.2. It was also known as The Web Artedian.
