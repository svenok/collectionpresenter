***************************
* GENERAL
***************************

The Collection Presenter is a package enginge for presenting natural history museum collections on a web server. It was designed to take output from The Artedian, a collection management system, but can be used for any collection straight away or with light tweaking.

Versions up to 0.1.8 are all obsolete and worked specifically for fish only.

Versions 0.6 and higher are entirely independent of systematic group presented.

Some requirements remain for collections:
They must be based on collection databases with catalog numbers and field numbers, and georeferenced using decimal degrees. Any collection database that can be exported to a Darwin Core 2 file will do for basic operations (search objects and localities).

The Collection Presenter handles acquisitions, requests, and images, but if not present, light tweaking can comment out those features.

Best of all: If you do not like the name Collection Presenter, you can rename your instatiation of the application to any decent name of your preference, as long as you leave all documentation intact, and keep the copyright statement and version number.

*************************
*   OPERATING SYSTEM    *
*************************
Windows or Linux, probably any system on which PHP and MySQL run

**************************
*   DATABASE BACKEND     *
**************************
Only MySQL 4 and 5. MySQL 5 is recommended.

In php.ini, make sure both mysql and mysqli extension modules are enabled, section Windows Extensions, and that the corresponding dlls are present in the extensions directory:

	extension=php_mysql.dll
	extension=php_mysqli.dll

The Module settings can be left at default for both mysql and mysqli.

*************************
*     WEB SERVER        *
*************************

Tested only with Apache 2.0.x. and 2.2.x

*************************
* 	SCRIPTING	*
*************************

Written for PHP 5.x, not tested with earlier versions of PHP.
Database access is through the mysqli extension, exceptionally the mysql extension.
PHP should run as a module, not as a cgi script.
PEAR classes are not included (yet).

Some Javascript is included for Google Maps and Nifty Corners.

*************************
*	DEPENDENCIES     *
*************************

The Collection Presenter uses the following script packages or libraries. They need to be downloaded and installed separately, and are not included with the Collection Presenter distribution. If images will not be shown, ImageMagick and Nifty Corners are not necessary. Graphs are constructed on the fly with JPgraph, but can be commented out from the stats.php page. FPDF is a PHP class for constructing pdf output. It can be commented out from the find.php page.

_Magick Wand for PHP_
Install ImageMagick and the corresponding Magick Wand dll

_Nifty Corners_
Add the applet to the java subdirectory and the stylesheet files to the style subdirectory

_JPgraph_
Install as per instruction. You should try to use JPgraph 2.X (for PHP 5).
I suggest placing the jpgraph class and all other files in a a subdirectory /jpgraph anywhere where accessible by the web server (e.g., C:\php\includes\jpgraph). Change the includes reference in php.ini to contain the path to /jpgraph.

Configure JPgraph to create cached files, expiring after a suitable time depending on how often you upgrade and your web traffic.

In jpg-config.inc.php, do the following:

1. Specify a cache directory as follows:
	if (isset($CACHE_DIR)){
	DEFINE ("CACHE_DIR", "$PATH_TO_DIR/$CACHE_DIR/");
	}
This ensures that if you have multiple applications or Collection Presenter instances, the cached graph file will end up within a specific directory.


2. Set caching to true:
DEFINE("USE_CACHE",true);

3. Set jpgraph to check for cached file before attempting to create a file:
DEFINE("READ_CACHE",true);


_FPDF_
Install as per instruction.

_GD2_
The GD package comes with PHP4 and PHP5. You need to enable it by uncommenting the corresponding line in the php.ini file, section Windows Extensions: 
	extension=php_gd2.dll

_Google maps_
You must register with Google and obtain a Google maps key to be able to use the Google Maps API to display maps from your server.
The key value must be stored in the wa_googledata.inc file.


*************************
*    CONFIGURATION      *
*************************
All *.inc files except wa_config.inc may be placed in a separate directory, preferably the includes subdirectory under the php directory. Do not place the wa_db.inc or wa_authority.inc files in a web server directory as they contain user names and passwords, but they must be accessible by the web server at run time.

All *.php files and the wa_config.inc should be placed in a directory under the webserver, e.g., ../htdocs/wartedian/

The following configuration of Collection Presenter web directory and subdirectories is required. Hard coded directory references may be removed in future versions.

htdocs
....
  /wartedian
     /icones [contains logos, the favicon, and other images part of the application]
     /cache [contains temporary files used by Google Maps and Google Earth, and graphs]
     /images [contains images from the database]
     /java [contains java applets]
     /style [contains the stylesheet files]
     /thumbs [contains temporary files used by the image handler]
     /wands [contains temporary files used by the image handler]


Edit the configuration file wa_config_default.inc to reflect your actual webserver configuration and other data and rename it wa_config.inc

Edit the database connector wa_db_default.inc to reflect your database name, user and password. Rename it wa_db.inc. If you use multiple instances of Collection Presenter, each must have its own wa_db.inc file. For example, if you have two instances of Collection Presenter, one for fish and one for herps, rename one wa_db_fish.inc and the other wa_db_herps.inc, and reference these files accordingly in each wa_config.inc (e.g., $DB_CONN = "wa_db_fish.inc"); more details on multiple instances below.

Edit the wa_authority_default.inc to have the preferred username and password and rename it wa_authority.inc. Even if you have several instances of Collection Presenter running, you only need one wa_authority.inc file.

Note: The /graphs subdirectory was removed as of v. 07.beta4

************************
* MULTIPLE INSTANCES   * 
************************	

Several instances of Collection Presenter can be run on the same server but require different directories, and the following changes to file names:

The the db connector file must be duplicated and have different names. 

Example: You have a herpetology and an ichthyology database:

Create a /herps and a /fish subdirectory under the httpd root, and add subdirectories as described above.

Make copies of wa_db_default.inc [default] and name them wa_db_fish.inc and wa_db_herp.inc. 

The wa_config.inc file must be edited to reflect actual conditions ($DB_CONN = "wa_db_fish.inc" and $DB_CONN = "wa_db_herp.inc")

The wa_db_*.inc file must be edited to call the right database.


**************************************
*       THE CONFIGURATION FILE       * 
**************************************

This file is named wa_config.inc in the distribution and is called from most *.php files. Rename as you prefer, and edit the variables as per below. All *.php and some includes files call the configuration file with require("wa_config.inc") and if you rename it, you must edit this line in all of them.

*** Application information
$APP_NAME = "Collection Presenter"; // normally do not change
$APP_VERSION = "0.7"; // do not change!

*** Web administrator information
$ADMIN_EMAIL = "my.name@myinstitution";
$ADMIN_NAME = "My Name";

*** Collection information 
$INST_NAME = "The Name of My Institution"; // e.g., Some Museum of Natural History
$COLL_NAME = "The Name of My Collection"; // e.g., Herpetology Collection
$DB_NAME = "The Name of My Database"; // e.g., Herpetology Database
$COLL_ACRONYM = "ABC";
$COLL_TAXON = "Taxon"; // e.g., Fishes

*** Web page header items
$PAGE_TITLE = "Acronym Discipline search:"; // e.g., ABC Herpetology search
$PAGE_AUTHOR = "Email and name of the person responsible for the web presentation"; // e.g., john.smith@some.edu John Smith
$PAGE_COPYRIGHT = "Email and name of the person responsible for the web presentation"; // e.g., john.smith@some.edu John Smith
$KWSET = "relevant keywords separated by comma"; // e.g., fish, ichthyology, museum

*** Contact email
$COMMENTS_TO1 ="mailto address"
$COMMENTS_TO2 ="mailto address"

** Directory locations
$SERVER_NAME = $_SERVER['SERVER_NAME']; // do not change
$WEBROOT = $_SERVER['DOCUMENT ROOT']; // do not change
$CACHE_DIR = "cache"; //do not change
$HOME_DIR = $SERVER_NAME."/the_name_of_the_directory_where_wartedian_php_files_reside"; // e.g., fishdb
$PATH_TO_DIR = "C:/Program Files/Apache Group/Apache2/htdocs/wartedian/"; //N.B. Example path to your wartedian directory

*** Customizable file names
$DB_CONN = "wa_db_default.inc"; // change to the name of the file opening the database connection
$RSS_FILE = "rss.xml"; // you can change, but keep xml extension 
$CSS_FILE = "wa_style.css"; //do not change
$FAVICON_FILE = "name_of_file.ico"; // Your favicon file name, e.g., abc.ico

*** Display customization
$EXPEDITIONS = "YES"; // alternative is "NO" if you have no expeditions
$IMAGES = "YES"; // alternative is "NO" if you have no images
$TRACKING = "RAP"; // alternative is NONE if you have no requests, acquisition or publications tables
$MULTILANG = "YES"; // alternative is NO if you do not wish to enable different language interfaces
$DEFAULT_LANG = "en" // alternatives are "sv", "es", and/or your custom language files. The corresponding wa_lang_*.inc must be present.

****************************************
* 	  CUSTOMIZE DISPLAY            *
****************************************

A minimum requirement to run the WebArtedian is to have database content corresponding to Darwin Core 2.0 version 1.2. In addition, you can present images, expeditions, references, accessions, and requests in a non-standard way. If you do not have those options, you must turn them off in the configuration file, setting $EXPEDITIONS and $IMAGES to "NO" and $TRACKING to "RAP". You may also wish to edit the about.php file to confirm to your particular settings. Affected files include:
index.php
stats.php
about.php
topmenu.inc

Affected files will not show images, expeditions, references, accessions, or requests as menu items or otherwise, if those items are turned off in the configuration file. You must, however, keep all database tables even though some of them may be empty, e.g., expeditions, requests, etc.


****************************************
*  THE LOCALISATION FILE               *			
****************************************

This file and functionality may be replaced by the language files?

To enhance searches for local names, and for searches for national data, a localisation glossary file is provided, wa_localisation.inc.

It contains only the following items:

$LANG_LANGUAGE = "Svenska"; // or, e.g., danska, norsk, Deutsch, English, Portugues, Italiano ...
$LANG_COUNTRY = "Sverige"; // or, e.g., Danmark, Norge, Deutschland, United Kingdom, Portugal, Italia ...
$LANG_COUNTRY_ENG_UC = "SWEDEN"; The English country name in upper case, must agree with a name in the Wartedian table
$LANG_COUNTRY_ENG = "Sweden";  // The English country name in sentence case
$LANG_COUNTRY_ENG_ADJECTIVE = "Swedish"; // The English country name in the adjective case
$LANG_PROVINCE = "L√§n"; // The national word for province/state
$LANG_DISTRICT = "Landskap"; // The national word for political division less than province/state
$LANG_COMMONNAME = "Svenskt artnamn"; // The national expression for Common name

Completing the localisation file is mandatory. Some searches will not work otherwise

****************************************
* GOOGLE MAPS CONFIGURATION            *
****************************************

Use of Google(TM) Maps requires a license from Google. Add the license to wa_googledata.inc. In that file you can specify alternative markers for the Google Maps data points ($GM_ICON).

The following marker images are provided:
gmicon_blue.png
gmicon_yellow.png

****************************************
*   OPTIONAL LANGUAGES MANAGEMENT      *
****************************************

To enable different language interfaces, all text is contained in variables. Files named wa_lang_**.inc contain the language specific text equivalents. As of 0.7beta2, the following language files are available:

English: wa_lang_en.inc
Spanish: wa_lang_es.inc
Swedish: wa_lang_se.inc

Other languages can be added by modifying the language selction options in index.php and translating wa_lang_en.inc into a language of choice. Rename it by replacing the "en" with the particular two-letter language ISO code of the new language.

Users select language from a form on the index.php page. 

Language options are managed by a cookie set to expire after one year. The cookie is set by index.php, and checked by a script in wa_counter.inc, which is included in wa_header.inc. If no cookie can be set, the default language is used. The default language is specified in the wa_config.inc file.
 
Updated versions of Collection Presenter will add new terms to the English language file. One must update customized translations accordingly.  If you wish to reduce or increase language options, you must modify the form in the index.php file accordingly. If for some reason you do not wish to use the language option, you can turn it off in wa_config.inc. 

****************************************
*  THE DATABASE CONNECTION FILE	       *
****************************************

This file is named wa_db_default.inc in the distribution. Rename as you prefer (e.g., wa_db_herp.inc) and edit the username, password and database name. Make the corresponding change in wa_config.inc at variable $DB_CONN.

<?php   $dbcnx=mysqli_connect("localhost", "USERNAME", "PASSWORD") or
	die("Could not connect: " . mysqli_error());
	mysqli_select_db($dbcnx,"DATABASENAME"); 				
?>

Normally the host will be localhost, otherwise substitute with the correct server name.

I do not put the database connection information in the wa_config file because not all files/scripts require a database connection; but this may change.


***************************************
* 					THE COUNTER				        *
***************************************

The file wa_counter.inc registers sessions, which correspond to site visits, and cookies relating to the language selection. It is included only in the wa_header.inc file. 

The counter as now stands is a quick-and-dirty fix, it will change in a future version.

***************************************
* 	SERVER FILES vs. INCLUDE FILES    *
***************************************

The server files are all named *.php. Overall they are a mix of html with style and database calls.

The includes files are  all named wa_*.inc and contain either functions or other short procedures not requiring any html. Generally they were meant to reduce the coding of otherwise rather bulky presentation pages. Except for wa_config.inc you can move them to your web directory if you prefer, but it is advised to leave the wa_db_***.inc and wa_authority.inc files outside the web server. 

 
***************************************
* FPDF
***************************************
PDF files are generated using the FPDF class. You must install and configure FPDF yourself; it is not included in the Collection Presenter distribution: http://www.fpdf.org/

The routine in wa_fn_makepdf.inc creates the pdf file. In the distribution it is called wa_fn_makepdf_default.inc. 

You must edit the following two lines at the top of wa_fn_makepdf.inc to reflect your own FPDF setting

	define(FPDF_FONTPATH,'C:/Program Files/Apache Group/Apache2/htdocs/fpdf/font/');

	require("C:\Program Files\Apache Group\Apache2\htdocs\fpdf\fpdf.php");

Add the database connection string to line 168, and rename the file wa_fn_makepdf.inc.

Because the FPDF script is OO, it does not use the wa_db_*.inc db connection and consequently, if you have several implementations of Collection Presenter, you must have a wa_fn_makepdf.inc file for each. Since the output is somewhat ugly, you may as well comment it out from find.php.

The pdf output option will improve in later versions of Collection Presenter.

***************************************
*	RSS FILES								*
***************************************

RSS files are updated running rssfeed.php manually upon database update. It creates up to five RSS 2.0 xml files:
$RSS_FILE (for new objects; you must supply a name in wa_config.inc)
rssreferences.xml (for references citing objects, taken from the wreferences table)
rssimages.xml (for objects, taken from the wimages table)
rssmodified.xml (for modified objects)
rssaccessions.xml (for new accessions, taken from the waccessions table)

The rss files are specified in wa_header.inc. If you do not have the waccessions, wreferences or wimages tables, you should delete or comment out the respective lines in the wa_header.inc file.


***************************************
*	IMAGES									*
***************************************

Images should be jpeg files with the extension *.jpg and be 1000 pixels wide to fit the display size defined in the css file. When called they will resize to smaller width by imageMagick. 

Images must reside in the /images subdirectory.

All images listed as imageCompressed in the wimages and wlocimages tables must be present on the server.

Image handling will need to be improved as follows:
a. should be able to manage more file types (TIFF)
b. should be able to manage any file dimension (smaller and larger than 1000 pixel width)

***************************************
*                ICONS								*
***************************************

Logos, favicons, maps, and other application specific images are contained in the /icones subdirectory.

The institution logo file, as specified by $INST_LOGO in the configuration file, is collection-specific, and you should provide your own. Recommended size is 70*60 pixels or close to that, and the background should be transparent.


***************************************
*          THE COMMENTS PAGE          *
***************************************
The comments.php page provide visitors an option to make comments, stored in the wa_comments table. There are a number of checks to prevent malicious users making damage, and also a web interface option for the administrator to delete inappropriate comments.

To delete a comment using the web interface, call the delcomment.php page which is locked using Apache authorization. The username and password are stored in the wa_authority.inc file.

You have to configue the Apache authorization yourself on each server. You can also use some other access method.

To enter a comment, the user must provide e-mail, name, comment, and the solution to a math operation based on a random number. Data entered are validated, and if validating stored in the comments table.

For the moment I recommend deactivating the comments table, until a spam safe version is available. There is a switch in the wa_config.inc file to turn off the comments page (set $COMMENTSPAGE = "NO";)


***************************************
*        DATABASE PRIVILEGES          *
***************************************
The default user (specified in wa_db_*.inc) must have SELECT privilege to the database.

To update the counter it is necessary also to set UPDATE privilege specifically on this table (wa_counter).

To maintain the comments table, set the ADD and DELETE privileges specifically on this table (wa_comments).

***************************************
* THE TABLES (for version 1.0)
***************************************
The wartedian table is an excerpt of data from object and locality tables, with pointers to images. All fields must be present, but many may be left with NULL data if not available. If expedition data or images are not available, you should disable portions of the application using those fields. If your catalog number is not an integer, you may change the field to varchar. dateCollected is a text representation of the date which is used instead of yearCollected, monthCollected, and dayCollected. dateCollected must be filled from those fields or other date information source.

A number of Darwin Core fields are omitted. The complete Darwin Core representation of your collection should be available from www.gbif.net; no need to duplicate it in Collection Presenter. Reasons for not duplicating Darwin Core is that (a) it is intended for data exchange involving many collections, (b) most collections will have NULL in many of the DarwinCore fields, and (c) Collection Presenter is intended for collection presentation rather than biodiversity informatics. Non-Darwin Core fields such as expedition and nationalName are relevant to include, as well as fields related to image presentation; expedition data, national names and images are important aspects of collection presentation but not covered in Darwin Core.

Your collection database may have different field names, may miss some of the fields, or may have them in a different format. When you export from your collection database, you can use operations to create or adapt fields, e.g., construct scientificName from concatenation of genus and species, or concatenate yearCollected, monthCollected, and dayCollected into a dateCollected text field, etc. If you do not have dateLastModified, you can set it to be the date of the export, etc. When you do the export you will conveniently change your field names into those used in Collection Presenter. There is no provision for mapping fields in Collection Presenter.

IMPORTANT: If you do not have images, or a separate Expeditions, Publications, Requests, or Accession table as present in the Artedian, you should turn off these options in the Menu. You do that in the wa_config_**'.inc file (set $EXPEDITIONS and $IMAGES to "NO" and $TRACKING to "NONE"). It is not necessary to delete the web or includes files relevant for those tables.

Tables namesprefixed "wa_" reside on the server and are fed from the server; table names starting with a simple "w" are data tables that need to be created and updated from the collection database.
